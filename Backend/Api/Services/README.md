# Services

This folder contains business logic services and their interfaces.

## Purpose
- Implement core business logic
- Handle data processing and manipulation
- Coordinate between different layers
- Provide reusable functionality across controllers

## Best Practices
- Keep services focused on single business concerns
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Implement interfaces for testability
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Keep business logic separate from data access
- Use proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Follow SOLID principles
- Make services stateless when possible

## Folder Structure
- **Interfaces/**: Service contracts and interfaces
- Service implementation files

## Example Structure
```csharp
public interface IExampleService
{
    Task<Result> ProcessDataAsync(Input input);
}

public class ExampleService : IExampleService
{
    // Service implementation
}
```

## Interface Guidelines
- Define clear contracts for services
- Use descriptive method names
- Include proper parameter validation
- Return appropriate result types
- Document expected behavior
