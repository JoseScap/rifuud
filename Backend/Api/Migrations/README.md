# Migrations

This folder contains Entity Framework Core database migration files.

## Purpose
- Track database schema changes over time
- Enable version control for database structure
- Provide rollback capabilities
- Ensure consistent database state across environments

## Best Practices
- Never edit migration files manually
- Use descriptive migration names
- Test migrations in development before production
- Keep migrations small and focused
- Review generated SQL before applying
- Use separate migrations for different features
- Document breaking changes
- Always backup production data before major migrations

## Commands
```bash
# Add new migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName

# Update database
dotnet ef database update

# Remove last migration
dotnet ef migrations remove
```

## Important Notes
- These files are auto-generated by Entity Framework
- Do not modify migration files directly
- Always review the generated SQL before applying to production
